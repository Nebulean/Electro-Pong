Welcome to "Electro-Pong", a simple reproduction of the game "Pong" with electrodynamics.
We will now briefly explain how it works.
!(BALL_APPEAR) This is the ball. It is a negatively charged particle.
As any other charged particles, it will be affected by electromagnetic fields.
!(BALL_DISAPPEAR, PLAYER_APPEAR) This is the player.
The ball will bounce on it, and electromagnetic fields can be generated from it.
